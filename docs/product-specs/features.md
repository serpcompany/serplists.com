# Features


## Auth And Account

- Better Auth is the canonical session layer for email sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, password changes, password reset, email verification, session lookup, and session revocation.
- Browser auth state uses Better Auth httpOnly cookies. The client does not store auth tokens.
- Protected routes preserve the originally requested destination and return users there after sign-in.
- Password strength rules are enforced for registration and password changes.
- `/dashboard/settings` is the canonical settings/account page.
- `/account` and `/dashboard/profile` redirect to `/dashboard/settings`.
- Public profiles remain available at `/profile/:username`.

## Dashboard Navigation

Canonical private routes:

- Templates: `/dashboard/templates`
- New template: `/dashboard/templates/new`
- Template detail: `/dashboard/templates/:id`
- Template editor: `/dashboard/templates/:id/edit`
- Import/export: `/dashboard/import-templates`
- Runs: `/dashboard/runs`
- Run detail: `/dashboard/runs/:id`
- Settings: `/dashboard/settings`
- Archive: `/dashboard/archive`, linked from the console sidebar and mobile menu

## Templates

- Users can create, edit, archive, restore, import, and export templates.
- Deleting a template or run archives it (the API sets `deleted_at`). `/dashboard/archive` lists the active context's archived templates and runs and restores them. Restoring respects plan limits and Organization roles, and shows the API's reason when it refuses.
- Template detail pages render a read-only preview first. Editing happens on `/dashboard/templates/:id/edit`.
- Template content updates reconcile into matching active, private runs for the same Resource Owner. Stable section, item, and sub-item IDs preserve run completion and notes across renames and reordering; new work arrives incomplete, and retired work leaves readiness calculations while remaining in run history.
- Public templates can be shared at `/profile/{username}/{templateSlug}`.
- Other Users can copy public templates into Personal or an authorized Organization when that ownership context's entitlement allows it.
- Template history is stored in `template_versions`; related actor/action history is stored in `audit_events`.

## Runs And Sharing

- Users can start checklist runs from templates.
- Runs store progress independently from templates.
- Runs record both the template content version last reconciled and a run revision. API responses expose `is_stale` when the source checklist structure is newer; metadata-only template edits do not stale runs.
- Completed, archived, and publicly shared runs are frozen when a template changes. A completed private run can be explicitly reconciled and reopened with `POST /api/checklists/:id/revalidate`.
- Runs that predate stable identities are conservatively marked stale during migration. Their legacy IDs are backfilled deterministically, and their completion/notes remain intact until explicit reconciliation.
- Run and template saves use optimistic revision/version markers. A stale editor receives `409 edit_conflict` instead of overwriting newer work.
- Run-level sharing creates public `/share/:token` links.
- Guests can open shared runs without logging in and update checklist completion state.
- Shared runs do not expose owner-only title editing or destructive actions.
- Current run gating is plan-limit based through active-run limits.

## Personal And Organization Contexts

- Users always have a Personal context and can belong to Organizations.
- Organization-owned templates and runs are shared with active Organization members.
- Context switching is available from the dashboard shell and persists locally. This remembered selection is transitional convenience state; canonical Organization routes are tracked in issue #212. A new tab starts in the remembered context; switching in one tab does not switch tabs that are already open. If the Organization list fails to load, the app shows an error with Retry (or Continue in Personal) instead of switching to Personal.
- Organization roles:
  - `owner`: full Organization management and ownership transfer.
  - `admin`: manage Organization settings, members, and invites.
  - `editor`: edit Organization templates and start runs.
  - `runner`: start and execute runs.
  - `viewer`: read-only access.
- Organization management currently lives on `/dashboard/settings`.
- Organization invites are link-based today. The legacy compatibility route `/team-invites/:token` and incoming invites on `/dashboard/settings` support acceptance.
- Organization and Template changes are recorded in D1-backed audit/history tables.

## Entitlements

- Free users have limited personal templates and active runs.
- Pro Users have paid Personal limits.
- Organization entitlements apply only inside the selected Organization context.
- A Free User in a paid Organization can use paid capabilities for that Organization. Their Personal context remains Free.
- The API is the source of truth for entitlements. UI gating mirrors API behavior.

## Dev Personas

Local seeds create these users:

- `checklists@serp.co`
- `admin@test.com`
- `john@test.com`
- `jane@test.com`
- `bob@test.com`

Password for all seeded users: `password123`.

`admin@test.com` and `jane@test.com` are treated as Pro dev personas. `john@test.com` and `bob@test.com` remain Free. Local seeds also include Organization Memberships, pending invites, Organization entitlement overrides, and audit rows. The underlying fixtures retain legacy `team` implementation names.

## Error Contract

- `401 Unauthorized`: the user must sign in.
- `403 upgrade_required`: the active Personal or Organization context needs a paid entitlement.
- `403 limit_reached`: the active Personal or Organization context hit a plan limit.
- `403 Forbidden`: the user is signed in but lacks the required role or permission.
- `503 billing_unavailable`: paid action cannot be started because billing config is unavailable.
- `503 auth_email_unavailable`: auth email delivery is unavailable for flows that require outbound email.
- `409 edit_conflict`: a template or run changed after the editor loaded it; refresh before retrying.

The client preserves API `status`, `code`, and `details` so UI behavior does not depend on string matching generic error messages.
